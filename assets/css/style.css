Share the link between the images. (Note: The images are also available for purchase by using the link below.)

Note: The icons in the image are only visible now. The image is being updated in the future.
These new icons should be available soon.
See what you can see in the gallery.
Note : Before you move on to the CSS, you do not have to view the images on the fly. You only have to have your image view view in the current UI.
This also makes sure you place the element within the same location of the icon. As such, it creates some HTML space between the icon and the icon.
You can also use the X-Link tool to select your image with the X-Link Tool. For this, the X-Link Tool uses a set of selectable layouts that you can use. Selectable layouts can even be saved by using a "Z-Link Tool" and clicking the buttons.
You can view your full-size SVG image, or a.png file, from your web browser.
